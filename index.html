                Hi, my name is George Davis. I am an Engineering Student from Seattle, Washington studying at Harvey Mudd College. 
                I am primarily interested in Embedded Systems and Electrical Engineering but have skills spanning many engineering disciplines. 
                My interest in engineering started with robotics but now with what I have learned at HMC have the skills to apply myself to many different subjects.</p>
