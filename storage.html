                Hi, my name is George Davis. I am an Engineering Student from Seattle, Washington studying at Harvey Mudd College. 
                I am primarily interested in Embedded Systems and Electrical Engineering but have skills spanning many engineering disciplines. 
                My interest in engineering started with robotics but now with what I have learned at HMC have the skills to apply myself to many different subjects.

                    <h3>Autonomous Underwater Robot</h3>
                    <p> Designed and built an autonomous underwater robot with a microcontroller and custom protoboard with temperature,
                        depth, and turbidity sensing circuits that used op-amps, an envelope detector, and a trans-impedance amplifier.
                        Effectively led the team through unexpected roadblocks with troubleshooting during a short data collection
                        period with skills in basic electrical equipment like multimeters, oscilloscopes, and breadboards/ protoboards.</p>
